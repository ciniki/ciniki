Art Gallery
	- Add the ability to have multiple headings in the menu bar, and decide
	  which galleries belong in each Major Category.  This will be done in the 
	  website manage section.
	- examples from jordashinc.com: Garden, Sculpture, Paintings, etc.
	- paintings, photographs, sculpture, jewellry, etc.
	- This would allow users to create their own organization structure, while keeping
	  the artgallery module simple.
	- Each Major Category could pull from multiple sources, artgallery, artclub, gallery, etc.

TODO:

- share buttons for artgallery
- when send test mail for mailing list, have it prompt for email address
- press tracker module, used to track mentions in the media/press, needs to also have a link checker.
	- example http://bnguffey.com/other1
- event payment through paypal for niagara pumphouse for events/courses (events first)
- artgallery/gallery descriptions, setup in artgallery module, or gallery module
- Email social icon in header/footer
- Deviant art social icon
- gallery drag-drop rearrangement/album management, same as what media was.

- Add pricing/plans page to website

Meeting with Lisa in Barrie:
- Need way to track sales at shows
- need way to track media (where has my work been mentioned)
	- Talk to her about this next time, get samples
- need to have social media integration
- Product/Inventory manager


Art Gallery
	- Add the ability to have multiple headings in the menu bar, and decide
	  which galleries belong in each Major Category.  This will be done in the 
	  website manage section.
	- examples from jordashinc.com: Garden, Sculpture, Paintings, etc.
	- paintings, photographs, sculpture, jewellry, etc.
	- This would allow users to create their own organization structure, while keeping
	  the artgallery module simple.
	- Each Major Category could pull from multiple sources, artgallery, artclub, gallery, etc.

Art Gallery
	- Add the ability to have multiple headings in the menu bar, and decide
	  which galleries belong in each Major Category.  This will be done in the 
	  website manage section.
	- examples from jordashinc.com: Garden, Sculpture, Paintings, etc.
	- paintings, photographs, sculpture, jewellry, etc.
